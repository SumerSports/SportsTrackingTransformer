   abstract="There has been rapid growth in the collection of player tracking data in recent years. These data, providing spatiotemporal locations of players and ball at high resolution, have spurred methodological developments in a range of sports. There have been impacts in the development of player performance measurement (e.g., distance traveled) and in the attribution of value to specific plays (e.g., expected points from a given position) or even specific actions within a play. This review highlights key methodological contributions via statistical and machine learning approaches. The studies and outcomes discussed show how sports can be a playground for extending analytical techniques in a range of areas. The review also describes the ongoing methodological challenges associated with the use of tracking data.",

    ABSTRACT={<p>American football is an appealing field of research for the use of information technology. While much effort is made to analyze the offensive team in recent years, reasoning about defensive behavior is an emergent topic. As defensive performance and positioning largely contribute to the overall success of the whole team, this study introduces a method to simulate defensive trajectories. The simulation is evaluated by comparing the movements in individual plays to a simulated league average behavior. A data-driven ghosting approach is proposed. Deep neural networks are trained with a multi-agent imitation learning approach, using the tracking data of players of a whole National Football League (NFL) regular season. To evaluate the quality of the predicted movements, a formation-based pass completion probability model is introduced. With the implementation of a learnable order invariant model, based on insights of molecular dynamical machine learning, the accuracy of the model is increased to 81%. The trained pass completion probability model is used to evaluate the ghosted trajectories and serves as a metric to compare the true trajectory to the ghosted ones. Additionally, the study evaluates the ghosting approach with respect to different optimization methods and dataset augmentation. It is shown that a multi-agent imitation learning approach trained with a dataset aggregation method outperforms baseline approaches on the dataset. This network and evaluation scheme presents a new method for teams, sports analysts, and sports scientists to evaluate defensive plays in American football and lays the foundation for more sophisticated data-driven simulation methods.</p>}

  abstract={Identifying key patterns of tactics implemented by rival teams, and developing effective responses, lies at the heart of modern football. However, doing so algorithmically remains an open research challenge. To address this unmet need, we propose TacticAI, an AI football tactics assistant developed and evaluated in close collaboration with domain experts from Liverpool FC. We focus on analysing corner kicks, as they offer coaches the most direct opportunities for interventions and improvements. TacticAI incorporates both a predictive and a generative component, allowing the coaches to effectively sample and explore alternative player setups for each corner kick routine and to select those with the highest predicted likelihood of success. We validate TacticAI on a number of relevant benchmark tasks: predicting receivers and shot attempts and recommending player position adjustments. The utility of TacticAI is validated by a qualitative study conducted with football domain experts at Liverpool FC. We show that TacticAI's model suggestions are not only indistinguishable from real tactics, but also favoured over existing tactics 90% of the time, and that TacticAI offers an effective corner kick retrieval system. TacticAI achieves these results despite the limited availability of gold-standard data, achieving data efficiency through geometric deep learning.},
